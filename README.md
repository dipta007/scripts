# My Scripts

Here are the shell scripts I use on my Ubuntu.

1. [mybashrc](./mybashrc) - Contains aliases for common programs I always run.
2. [setup.sh](./setup.sh) - A shell script to help me setup my pc once I freshly install ubuntu on a system. Automatically installs necessary softwares and packages I use.
3. [port-free](./port-free) - A shell script that takes a port number as arguement and makes it free by killing the process which is keeping it busy.

# Cool Ideas

Some cool script ideas to implement ( if I ever get time ):

1. backup.sh that tars up the contents of a directory and sends it to my gmail account. - [reference](http://stackoverflow.com/a/188181)
