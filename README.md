# My Scripts

Here are the shell scripts I use on my Ubuntu.

1. [mybashrc](./mybashrc) - Contains aliases for common programs I always run.
2. [setup.sh](./setup.sh) - A shell script to help me setup my pc once I freshly install ubuntu on a system. Automatically installs necessary softwares and packages I use.
