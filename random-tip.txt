#3 Linux Tips: "apropos <keyword>" command will display all commands where the keywords appear in their short descriptions. For example, "apropos mount".

#4 Linux Tips: "less" is a program to view file contents. It allows both backward and forward movement. Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi.

#5 Linux Tips: While viewing files with "less", use `ctrl + f` to go down one screen and `ctrl + b` to go up one screen. For half screen movement use `ctrl + d` and `ctrl + u`. For line movement use `j` and `k` or arrow keys.

#6 Linux Tips: You can view archived or compressed files (tar,tar.gz,tgz,zip) files using "less".

#7 Linux Tips: In "less", you can match words using "/<text>" for forward match and "?<text>" for backward match. For next match "n" and for previous match "N".

#9 Linux Tips: You can use "nmap -sn <ip-address/mask>" to find out who are connected to your network and what is their ip address.

#10 Linux Tips: If you want to run a command as a different user, you can use "su" for that: "su - <user-name> -c '<command>'"

#11 Linux Tips: You can display one-line manual page descriptions using "whatis <command-name>"

#13 Linux Tips: You can set nicknames to ip address's in /etc/hosts like "<ip-address> <nick>". For example, "192.168.0.1 router". Now you can use commands like "ping router".
