# My Scripts

Here are the shell scripts I use on my Ubuntu.

1. [celica](./celica) - Work related script.
1. [extract](./extract) - Every time I see a tar.gz/tgz/zip file, I have to google to figure out how to unzip it. Most of the time I care to only extract files, nothing else. Who is going to remember all those flags out there? This script simplifies things.
1. [fvp](./fvp) - Frequently Visited Path aliases are stored here.
1. [load-keyspace](./load-keyspace) - Work related script
1. [mybashrc](./mybashrc) - Contains aliases for common programs I always run.
1. [port-free](./port-free) - A shell script that takes a port number as arguement and makes it free by killing the process which is keeping it busy.
1. [prefix](./prefix) - A script to quickly add/remove prefix string to/from all files in a directory
1. [random-tip](./random-tip) - A script that picks a random line from 'random-tip.txt' and displays through cowsay. This script is added to mybashrc so that it gets called each time a new bash is opened.
1. [setup.sh](./setup.sh) - A shell script to help me setup my pc once I freshly install ubuntu on a system. Automatically installs necessary softwares and packages I use.

# Cool Ideas

Some cool script ideas to implement ( if I ever get time ):

1. backup.sh that tars up the contents of a directory and sends it to my gmail account. - [reference](http://stackoverflow.com/a/188181)

1. "goup <n>" to go up n times -> cd ../../../<n times>
